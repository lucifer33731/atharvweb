# Proposal Page

Welcome to my **Proposal Page**! This is a simple and romantic webpage that I created to express my feelings in a fun and interactive way. It features a proposal question and two options: "Yes" and "No". If the user clicks "No", the button escapes playfully!

---

## Features

- **Interactive**: Click the "Yes" or "No" buttons to respond to the proposal.
- **Fun Animation**: The "No" button moves away from the cursor, creating a playful experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both mobile devices and desktop computers.

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage in your browser (desktop or mobile).
2. You'll see a proposal with a "Yes" and "No" button.
3. Click on one of the buttons:
    - If you click **Yes**, a message of joy will appear.
    - If you click **No**, the "No" button will try to escape!
4. Share the link with friends, family, or anyone you want to impress!
